If you are building a native application, then the Authorization Code flow with a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is the recommended method for controlling the access between your application and a resource server.

See [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#authorization-code-with-pkce-flow) for more information on the authorization code with PKCE flow, including why to use it.

> **Note:** Some browsers have begun blocking third-party cookies by default, disrupting Okta functionality in certain flows.
