The Client Credentials flow is recommended for server-side (AKA confidential) client applications with no end user, which normally describes machine-to-machine communication. Your application needs to securely store its Client ID and secret and pass those to Okta in exchange for an access token. 

See [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect overview](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#client-credentials-flow) for OAuth 2.0 and Client Credentials flow concepts.
