Okta recommends using existing libraries and OAuth 2.0 helper methods to implement your authentication flow. You can use one of Okta's SDKs or an open-source library if an appropriate Okta SDK is not available. See [Languages & SDKs overivew](/code/) for a list of Okta SDKs that you can download to start using with your app.

Refer to [Configure the SDK](/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/configure-the-sdk) for instructions on how to install and use Okta front-end framework SDKs.
