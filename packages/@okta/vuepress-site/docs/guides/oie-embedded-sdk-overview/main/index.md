This guide walks you through the steps to download, set up, and configure
the SDK. It also provides you with a sample app that you can use to learn about the SDK and integrate it into your app. After you complete the initial steps, you can walk through the available use cases that highlight the supported features such as sign-in, multifactor authentication, and self-registration.

## Reasons for using the embedded SDK

You would typically choose the embedded SDK to enable you to build out your identity solution, which includes the ability to:

* Provide a fully customized user experience
* Code against a high-level SDK interface
* Provide greater flexibility to solve your specific branding requirements

See [Embedded vs redirect authentication](/docs/concepts/hosted-vs-embedded/#okta-hosted-vs-customer-hosted) for a full list of reasons for using the embedded SDK and a complete overview of the different deployment models.

## The SDK flow

The SDK integrates into your app by using a native language interface and communicates directly with Okta APIs by using a REST interface. The following is a summary of the SDK flow.

## Get started with the SDK

To get started using the SDK:

1. [Create your account and set up your Okta org](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-org-setup/aspnet/main/).
1. [Download and set up the SDK and sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-common-download-setup-app/aspnet/main/).
1. [Run the SDK sample app](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-run-sample/aspnet/main/).
1. Integrate the SDK into your app (while using the sample app as your guide) by using the available [use cases](/docs/guides/oie-embedded-sdk-use-cases/aspnet/oie-embedded-sdk-use-case-overview/).
